As a counter-balance to the social activities the MCR puts on, we also try to organise a
 number of events of a more intellectual nature. These fall into two broad categories. 
 The focal point of the year for the academic side of the MCR’s work is the annual conference, 
 typically held near the beginning of Easter Term each year. 
 All graduates are welcome to present their work at this conference, whether in the form of 
 an oral or powerpoint presentation, or through the medium of a poster. The day ends with a 
 key-note speech and a dinner. Look out for more information about the 
 conference closer to the time!

The second aspect of the MCR’s academic work is the Graduates & Fellows Symposia,
 organised with the support of the SCR. For these, we generally invite fellows of the 
college (usually leading academics in their field), or occasionally academics from outside, 
to deliver presentations on their research (for more on this term’s symposia see the calendar. 
Symposia follow Grad Hall and include additional cheese and port in Upper Hall. 
There will be opportunities to talk with the speaker at pre-dinner drinks, over dinner 
and after the symposia. We ask the speakers to remember that the audience comprises 
grads from various disciplines, so generally their presentations are non-specialist 
(speakers are, however, usually happy to take more specialised questions). 
This keeps the symposia accessible to all.

There is also a graduate study room available; [*click here to learn more*](http://mcr.jesus.cam.ac.uk/mcr-study-centre/).


We’re always looking to improve our academic events, so if you have any suggestions for
 who might come and speak at a symposium, or what events you’d like to see us put on, 
 please get in touch with the [Academic officer](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=017Uowu084OmTuZwWniPbOow==&c=WWrM2esLbjx5625bc_hLlIVyGyX0rAF6bXR4E28yh3c=).

# Symposia

The symposia are relaxed, informal after-dinner events.  They start around 9.15 pm in Upper Hall,
 following Grad Hall and include port, cheese and coffee.  The speaker will usually join us 
 for the meal beforehand, and graduates are encouraged to engage them in discussion.  
 The topics covered are meant to be of general interest, so please come along even if 
 something looks to be a million miles away from your own subject – academic adventure 
 is the point!  Speakers are asked to make their talks accessible and interesting to 
 non-specialists and we try to choose speakers who are known for being entertaining!

# Graduate conference

The Graduate Conference is held every year towards the end of the Easter break. It give 
 graduates an opportunity to share their work with their fellow students and the 
 fellowship of college. It may also be attended by alumni of the college.

Essentially this is an opportunity for Grads to tell other Grads about their work.
 While the format changes a little every year, we are eager to encourage as many grads 
 as possible to communicate their work through presentations and posters. The work you 
 present can be pretty much anything. Maybe you did a Masters at a different university 
 and you would like to present that? Maybe you would like to present what the plans are 
 for your PhD. (remember the conference is in April/May so by then you will have a 
 lot more to say then than you do at the beginning of the year). 
 Maybe you are about to finish your PhD and you would like the experience. 
 Maybe you have other academic interests beyond your work and you’d prefer to talk about them.
