The collegiate system at Cambridge is near-unique, and while it's advantages may sometimes
 be less obvious to those of us this side of a Batchelor's degree, it offers a number of 
 opportunities rarely afforded in academia. The College brings together a group of young 
 academics - the graduate students - who study a dizzyingly broad range of subjects, 
 yet who study, play and live in a very close-knit, supportive and nurturing environment.
 
These pages contain videos, abstracts and posters from previous **Graduate conferences** and
 **3 minute thesis** events.
